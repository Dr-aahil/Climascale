            <hr>

            <p class="py-lg-3 py-5">
                <strong>Fact 1:</strong>The term global warming refers to the long-term warming of the planet. The term climate change encompasses global warming, but refers to the broader range of changes that are happening to our planet. <br>
            </p>

            <p class="py-lg-3 py-5"> <strong>Fact 2</strong>: These broader climate changes include: rising sea levels, shrinking mountain glaciers, accelerating ice melt in Greenland, Antarctica and the Arctic, and shifts in flower and plant blooming times.</p>

            <p class="py-lg-3 py-5"> <strong>Fact 3</strong>: Human activity, especially greenhouse gas emissions, is considered the dominant cause of temperature increases. </p>

            <p class="py-lg-3 py-5"> <strong>Fact 4</strong>: The greenhouse effect refers to the way the Earth’s atmosphere traps and absorbs solar energy.</p>

            <p class="py-lg-3 py-5"> <strong>Fact 5</strong>: The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was formed in 1988 to collect and assess evidence on climate change. Since then, it has produced a series of alarming climate models. Under these models, most of the planet’s
                ice cover would melt by the end of the century and trigger a cascade of irreversible consequences, including flooding strong enough to engulf entire cities.</p>

            <p class="py-lg-3 py-5"> <strong>Fact 6</strong>: Paleoclimatology—or the study of changes in climate throughout Earth’s history—uses evidence found in tree rings, ocean sediment, coral reefs, and layers of sedimentary rocks to determine that current warming is occurring
                roughly 10 times faster than the post-ice age warming.</p>

            <p class="py-lg-3 py-5"> <strong>Fact 7</strong>: By 2060, the cost of inaction on climate change is predicted to reach a staggering $44 trillion, with the highest anticipated GDP losses in the Middle-East, Northern, and Sub-Saharan Africa, and South and Southeast
                Asia.
            </p>

            <p class="py-lg-3 py-5"> <strong>Fact 8</strong>: In 2018, there were 14 extreme-weather events that resulted in more than $1 billion in damages.</p>

            <p class="py-lg-3 py-5"> <strong>Fact 9</strong>: The average number of people exposed to heatwaves has increased by approximately 125 million since the beginning of the century.</p>

            <p class="py-lg-3 py-5"> <strong>Fact 10</strong>: Community-led nonprofits working to fight climate change are underfunded.</p>

            <p class="py-lg-3 py-5"> <strong>Fact 11</strong>: The concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2)​​​​​​​ in our atmosphere, as of May 2020, is the highest it has been in human history.</p>

            <p class="py-lg-3 py-5"> <strong>Fact 12</strong>: NASA data show that average global temperatures in 2019 were 1.8 degrees F (0.98 degrees C) warmer than the 20th century average. 3 In fact, the five warmest years in the 1880–2019 record have all occurred since 2015.</p>

            <p class="py-lg-3 py-5"> <strong>Fact 13</strong>: Eleven percent of all global greenhouse gas emissions caused by humans are due to deforestation comparable to the emissions from all of the passenger vehicles on the planet. </p>

            <p class="py-lg-3 py-5"> <strong>Fact 14</strong>: Eleven percent of all global greenhouse gas emissions caused by humans are due to deforestation comparable to the emissions from all of the passenger vehicles on the planet. </p>

            <p class="py-lg-3 py-5"> <strong>Fact 15</strong>: Tropical forests are incredibly effective at storing carbon, providing at least a third of the mitigation action needed 7 to prevent the worst climate change scenarios. Yet nature-based solutions receive only 3% of
                all climate funding.</p>

            <p class="py-lg-3 py-5"> <strong>Fact 16</strong>: Natural climate solutions such as restoring degraded forests could create as many as 39 jobs per million dollars spent — that's a job-creation rate more than six times higher than the oil and gas industry. </p>

            <p class="py-lg-3 py-5"> <strong>Fact 16</strong>: More than 1 million species are at risk of extinction by climate change </p>
